INTO AN EXECUTOR


## Freezer addon (separate script, requires GGCMD first)
After executing GGCMD, you can execute this local addon script:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flepo-hack/GGCMD/refs/heads/main/Experimental"))()
```

It auto-enables freezer look and gives two tools: **Ice Slide** and **Eat**.


## StarBat addon (separate script, requires GGCMD first)
After executing GGCMD, execute:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flepo-hack/GGCMD/refs/heads/main/Bat"))()
```

This gives 2 tools:
- **Star Fly**: triggers GGCMD fly + back-arm white smoke/glitter effect
- **Star Bat**: star bat hit with knockback + flashbang effect (+ `;fling` support)


## Clown Van cinematic addon (separate script, requires GGCMD first)
After executing GGCMD, execute:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flepo-hack/GGCMD/refs/heads/main/Van"))()
```

This runs a cinematic sequence with nearest target: sink attempt, van arrives, door opens, robot hand grab, drive-off, then fling attempt.
