## Freezer addon (separate script, requires GGCMD first)
After executing GGCMD, you can execute this local addon script:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flepo-hack/GGCMD/refs/heads/main/Experimental"))()
```

It auto-enables freezer look and gives two tools: **Ice Slide** and **Eat**.
